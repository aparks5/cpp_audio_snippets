# cpp_audio_snippets

This repo contains snippets of code relevant to the embedded audio world. This code is not made with any purpose other for self-education.

It is probably not beneficial for you to simply read this code, it is meant for me to document my process of education and learning more fundamental algorithms.

Most of my day to day job is focused on making incremental changes and much of it is about structuring and solving larger problems. I may focus on patterns at some point, but for now the focus here should be small algorithms.

In many cases I will not be creating classes and enums but rather single functions with tests that do very particular things. 

Some code is designed to be audio domain specific, others are general utilities

most of these should be testable with godbolt.org unless otherwise noted
